## Example Rails 3.2 project using CarrierWave[1] and the jQuery File Upload plugin[2]

I used this project to explore how to use the jQuery File Upload plugin in Rails. I've tried to keep the commits small so that others can follow along and add the jQuery File Upload plugin to their own projects.
